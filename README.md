# Binary Calculator 🧮

## Project Description

This project implements a simple **binary calculator** in **C++** that:

- Converts a **decimal number** to **binary**
- Computes its **One's complement**
- Computes its **Two's complement**
- Supports multiple bit-widths (4, 8, 16, 32, 64 bits)
- Repeats until the user decides to quit

It is a console-based interactive program that demonstrates **number representation** and **binary arithmetic with complements**.

---

## Features

- Input any non-negative decimal integer
- Choose the bit-size for representation:
  - 4-bit
  - 8-bit
  - 16-bit
  - 32-bit
  - 64-bit
- Validates bit-size input (forces user to select one of the allowed sizes)
- Checks if the selected bit-size is sufficient to represent the number
- Displays:
  - Binary representation
  - One's complement
  - Two's complement
- Allows repeated calculations in a loop

## How It Works

### 1. Bit-Size Validation

The program asks the user to select a bit size (4, 8, 16, 32, or 64).  
If the input is not one of these, the user is repeatedly prompted until a valid size is entered.

This ensures the program only works with predefined and supported bit-widths.

---

### 2. Range Check

Before converting, the program checks:

- If the decimal value is greater than or equal to 2^(bit-size)  

If this happens, the program prints a message that the chosen size is **not enough** to represent the number in binary with that many bits, and skips the rest of the processing for that iteration.

---

### 3. Decimal to Binary Conversion

The decimal number is converted to binary and stored in a dynamically allocated integer array of length equal to the chosen bit size.

The conversion:

- Fills bits from **right to left**
- Uses integer division by 2 and modulo 2 to extract bits
- Ensures the full bit-width is used (leading zeros included)

Example (conceptually):

- Input: `5`, bit-size: `4`
- Binary: `0101`

---

### 4. One's Complement

Once the binary representation is computed, the **One's complement** is generated by:

- Replacing every `0` bit with `1`
- Replacing every `1` bit with `0`

This effectively inverts all bits in the array.

---

### 5. Two's Complement

The **Two's complement** is computed from the One's complement by:

- Adding `1` to the least significant bit
- Propagating the carry towards the most significant bit

Algorithm:

- Start from the last bit (rightmost)
- If the bit is `1` and carry is `1`, it becomes `0`, carry stays `1`
- Otherwise, add carry, store result, and set carry to `0`

This is the standard way to compute Two's complement of a binary number.

## User Interaction Flow

1. Program starts and displays a **Binary Calculator** title.
2. User is asked to:
   - Enter a **decimal number**
   - Enter a **bit size** (4, 8, 16, 32, or 64)
3. Program:
   - Validates bit size
   - Checks if the number fits in the selected bit size
   - If valid, prints:
     - Binary representation
     - One's complement
     - Two's complement
4. User is asked:
   - Press `'a'` to quit  
   - Press any other key to continue with another calculation
5. Loop continues until `'a'` is entered.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g. `g++`, `clang++`, MSVC)
- Standard C++ headers:
  - `<iostream>`
  - `<cmath>`

No external libraries are required.

---

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Pointer usage and dynamic memory allocation (`new` / `delete[]`)
- Binary number representation
- One's and Two's complement
- Input validation and control flow
- Basic bitwise-style algorithms using arithmetic (`/ 2`, `% 2`)

---

## Possible Improvements

- Add support for **negative numbers** and signed interpretation
- Add input validation for non-integer or invalid decimal input
- Display intermediate steps for educational purposes
- Refactor to use `std::vector<int>` instead of raw pointers
- Add a menu to select operations separately (e.g., just binary, or just Two's complement)
